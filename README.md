# [CareWatch](http://www.thecarewatch.com/) project
## python code for raspberry pi 
the carewatch company wants to display their product on the CES
with a team (for CodeGorilla) we emulated a CareWatch  
we connected it to a i2c lcd screen  
we connected 2 buttons  
1 button for manual alerting  
1 button emulating fall detector  
we generated a random Heartbeat and a random temperature 
all alarms are sent to a PHP module to be put in a database  
and showing the generated alarms on the lcd screen  
and the serial number of the pi is shown on screen  

the github for website where the data is stored and displayed [here](https://github.com/ErwinOudG/CareWatch)
